This project is currently undergoing ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

Tigersoul is a platformer metrovania esque game about war , gods, and robots

we are a month late to the party, but turns out humans only need around 5 hours of sleep to function effectively

this is a project unfortunately still undergoing development. our team( me myself and i ) have managed to scrape together a demo comprised of chapter 0 and some limited areas of chapter 1

HOW TO RUN (IMPORTANT)

for windows computers(x64 only, arm support coming)

from the itch.io page , https://bytebybite.itch.io/tigersoul , download the zip file and extract. inside, you will find Tigersoul.exe, double click to execute and ignore all warning by whatever trusted antivirus that happens to flag this admittedly suspicious software

if there happens to be a warning along the lines of "windows protected your pc" , click on "more info" , then "run anyways". My trojans will take care of the rest/j

from then on out, whatever happens is not under warranty , and if the game fails to run at any point beyond this , remember to send me a hostile email at eclipseanimationsbbyb@gmail.com


Filler to reach requirements :
Tigersoul is a metroidvania about walking tanks, complete with walking, talking, fully animated, and (mostly) historically accurate characters.
you play as a Tiger H1 tank , and you explore the remnants of a war torn civilisation, meeting interesting , hostile and different varieties of esoteric along the way. run , jump , run harder , wall jump , and beat things down through this hastily crafted adventure. 

about the team : 
eclipse has a background in animation and art , as well as a mind for logic and an attitude for "good enough". He enjoys daydreaming during important classes that have significant impacts upon his future. This is far from his first game project , just the one with any chance of ever seeing the light of day.
